# CIS550-Project

What: This zip file is the culmination of our CIS 450/550 final project: Mapper. In it, we provided a simple way to access and query US civic data which was generated by the federal and state governments

Frontend: The frontend is composed of a Node.js application running the express framework which allows us a middleware between the data on the RDS and MLab instances and the client's rendered pages on the browser

Backend: The Node.js application communicates with two live data instances. Firstly, a MySQL RDS instance which holds most of the context specific information about the states (population, obsesity, towns). Secondly, a MongoDB instance on MLab which holds our user information
